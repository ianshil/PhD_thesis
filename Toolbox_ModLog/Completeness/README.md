# Completeness

Here, we provide the formalisation of completeness results.

In Completeness, each folder has a specific role:

       wKL  ==>  contains files showing the completeness of wKL w.r.t. the local semantics consequence relation
       sKL  ==>  contains a file showing the completeness of wKL w.r.t. the local semantics consequence relation
