# Toolbox: Modal Logic

Here, we provide the formalisation of the general notions we defined in Part I: Toolbox.

In Toolbox_ModLog, each folder has a specific role:

                         Syntax  ==>  contains files defining propositional and first-order modal languages
    Generalized_Hilbert_calculi  ==>  contains files defining the generalized Hilbert calculi wKH and sKH, and showing properties about them
                Sequent_calculi  ==>  contains files defining the sequent calculus wKS, and shows cut-elimination for it
               Kripke_semantics  ==>  contains files defining Kripke semantics for the propositional and first-order modal languages
                      Soundness  ==>  contains files showing that wKH and sKH are sound w.r.t. the local and global semantics consequence relations
                   Completeness  ==>  contains files showing that wKH and sKH are complete w.r.t. the local and global semantics consequence relations
