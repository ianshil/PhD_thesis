# Modal Generalized Hilbert Calculi

Instructions for compiling all the files in Generalized_Hilbert_calculi.
=========================================================================================

Run "make Generalized_Hilbert_calculi_all" which compiles all files in Generalized_Hilbert_calculi.


NOTES
-----

In Generalized_Hilbert_calculi, each file has a specific role:

                      K_GHC.v  ==>  defines the generalized Hilbert calculi wKH and sKH
                   K_logics.v  ==>  shows that wKH and sKH define finitary logics
      K_extens_interactions.v  ==>  shows that wKH is a subset of sKH, but that they share the same theorems
    K_wKH_meta_interactions.v  ==>  shows proof-theoretic propertis of wKH
    K_wKH_meta_interactions.v  ==>  shows proof-theoretic propertis of sKH
