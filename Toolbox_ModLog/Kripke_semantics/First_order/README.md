# First-Order Kripke Semantics

Instructions for compiling all files in First_order.
=========================================================================================

1. Run "make Syntax" which compiles all files found in ../../Syntax directory.

2. Run "make K_FO_Kripke_sem.vo" which compiles all files in First_order.


NOTES
-----

In First_order, each file has a specific role:

             K_FO_Kripke_sem.v  ==>  defines the Kripke semantics for the first-order modal language
