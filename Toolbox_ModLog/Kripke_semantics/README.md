# Kripke semantics

Here, we provide the formalisation of the Kripke semantics.

In Kripke_semantics, each folder has a specific role:

       Propositional  ==>  contains files defining Kripke semantics for the propositional modal language
         First_order  ==>  contains a file defining Kripke semantics for the first-order modal language
